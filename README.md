PublicPlayground
================
This is a public repository for testing purpose only.

It is meant to help people getting started with GIT and GitHub, 
without the risk of messing up an existing repository where useful files are shared/kept.

Do NOT put anything in here, that you need to keep.

Do not modify or delete the .git-subdirectory !

Feel free to add or modify files in this reposity. You can try out versions, do local diffs, create your own branch, try to merge different versions ...

You may even delete files, with some exceptions:
- do not delete this readme-file
- do not delete the .git-directory
- do not delete the .gitignore

Have fun,
Ralf
